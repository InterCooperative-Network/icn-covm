# Infrastructure Cleanup & Optimization PR

## Overview

This PR implements a significant refactoring of the ICN-COVM codebase to improve modularity, maintainability, and prepare for future feature expansion. The changes standardize the project structure, improve VM operations organization, enhance governance functionality, and add CI/testing infrastructure.

## Key Changes

### VM Module Refactoring
- Created a modular operation handler system with trait-based dispatch
- Separated VM operations by domain (storage, governance, identity, arithmetic)
- Added comprehensive tests for each operation handler
- Added detailed documentation for the VM architecture

### Governance Template System
- Implemented a reusable template registry for governance processes
- Added file-backed storage with versioning for templates
- Created CLI commands for template management (list, view, edit, apply)
- Added documentation for the governance system

### Federation Improvements
- Added connection retry with exponential backoff
- Created comprehensive documentation for the federation module
- Prepared CLI commands for federation management

### CI and Quality Infrastructure
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for CI
- Set up standardized Rust configuration
- Added pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Added documentation generation

## Documentation Improvements
- Added README files for key modules (VM, Governance, Federation)
- Created architecture diagrams and explanations
- Added detailed API documentation
- Created example usage scenarios

## Testing Enhancements
- Added unit tests for new components
- Improved test coverage for existing functionality
- Set up test infrastructure for typed values

## Future Work
- Complete implementation of federation CLI commands
- Add end-to-end tests for governance workflows
- Migrate remaining monolithic functions to the modular architecture
- Expand TypedValue support throughout the codebase

## Breaking Changes
None. This PR maintains backward compatibility while preparing for future enhancements.

## Testing Performed
- Unit tests for all new components
- Manual testing of CLI commands
- Verification of feature compatibility
