# Implement VM Storage Routing & Integration

This PR adds routing capabilities to the VM allowing it to work with different storage backends (in-memory and file-based). This work is part of the storage rewrite to provide a more flexible and robust storage system.

## Key Features

- Storage backend switching via command-line arguments
- Persistent storage with file-based backend
- Version history and versioning support
- Storage audit logs 
- Demo programs showcasing various storage capabilities

## Testing

The core functionality has been tested with several demo programs:
- Basic storage tests
- Version history demonstration
- Persistent counter example

Some tests are failing due to API changes and will need to be updated separately.

## Documentation

- Updated storage.md with the new API details
- Added storage_integration_guide.md with integration examples

## Breaking Changes

- Storage API has been updated to use the StorageBackend trait
- Example code will need to be updated to use the new API

## Future Work

Further test updates and cleanup will be done in a separate PR.
