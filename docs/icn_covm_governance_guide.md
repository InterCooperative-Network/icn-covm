# ICN-COVM Governance Implementation Guide

## Introduction

The ICN Cooperative Virtual Machine (ICN-COVM) provides specialized primitives for implementing democratic governance in cooperative organizations. This guide offers a detailed exploration of these governance primitives, with practical examples and best practices for integrating them into your cooperative's decision-making processes.

## Governance Foundation

Effective cooperative governance relies on transparent, accessible, and fair decision-making mechanisms. The ICN-COVM provides primitives that address key aspects of democratic governance:

1. **Representation**: Who can participate in decisions and how
2. **Deliberation**: The process of discussing and refining proposals
3. **Decision-making**: The mechanisms for determining outcomes
4. **Accountability**: Ensuring decisions are properly implemented

## Core Governance Primitives

The ICN-COVM implements the following governance primitives:

### 1. Liquid Delegation (`liquiddelegate`)

Liquid delegation implements a form of liquid democracy where members can:
- Directly participate in decisions
- Delegate their voting power to trusted representatives
- Change or revoke delegations at any time
- Have their delegation transitively flow through multiple representatives

#### Syntax

```
liquiddelegate <from> <to>
```

Where:
- `<from>` is the identifier of the delegating member
- `<to>` is the identifier of the representative receiving the delegation

#### Example: Basic Delegation

```
# Alice delegates to Bob
liquiddelegate "alice" "bob"

# Carol delegates to Alice (which transitively flows to Bob)
liquiddelegate "carol" "alice"

# Calculate effective voting power for Bob
# (Bob's own power + Alice's power + Carol's power)
```

#### Example: Delegation Chain

```
# Setup chain of delegations
liquiddelegate "david" "carol"
liquiddelegate "carol" "bob"
liquiddelegate "bob" "alice"

# Later, Carol changes her delegation directly to Alice
liquiddelegate "carol" "alice"
```

### 2. Ranked-Choice Voting (`rankedvote`)

Implements instant-runoff voting (IRV) with ranked ballots, allowing members to:
- Rank candidates in order of preference
- Have secondary preferences count if their first choice is eliminated
- Achieve majority support through sequential elimination of least-supported candidates

#### Syntax

```
rankedvote <num_candidates> <num_ballots>
```

Where:
- `<num_candidates>` is the number of candidates in the election
- `<num_ballots>` is the number of ballots to process

The operation expects ballots to be on the stack, where each ballot consists of `num_candidates` ranked preferences (pushed in reverse order, with last choice first).

#### Example: Simple Election

```
# Define 3 candidates (0, 1, 2) and 5 ballots

# Ballot 1: Ranks candidates as 1, 0, 2
push 2.0  # Last choice
push 0.0  # Second choice
push 1.0  # First choice

# Ballot 2: Ranks candidates as 0, 1, 2
push 2.0  # Last choice
push 1.0  # Second choice
push 0.0  # First choice

# Ballot 3: Ranks candidates as 2, 1, 0
push 0.0  # Last choice
push 1.0  # Second choice
push 2.0  # First choice

# Ballot 4: Ranks candidates as 0, 2, 1
push 1.0  # Last choice
push 2.0  # Second choice
push 0.0  # First choice

# Ballot 5: Ranks candidates as 2, 0, 1
push 1.0  # Last choice
push 0.0  # Second choice
push 2.0  # First choice

# Run the ranked-choice vote
rankedvote 3 5

# Result is now on top of the stack (the winning candidate ID)
store winner

# Output the winner
emit "Winner is candidate: "
load winner
emit "0"  # Assuming 0 wins in this example
```

### 3. Vote Threshold Check (`votethreshold`)

Verifies that the support for a proposal meets a specified threshold, enabling:
- Majority voting (>50%)
- Super-majority requirements (e.g., 2/3, 3/4)
- Consensus policies (approaching 100%)

#### Syntax

```
votethreshold <threshold>
```

Where:
- `<threshold>` is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the required portion of votes

The operation expects two values on the stack:
- The total votes cast
- The votes in favor

#### Example: Majority Vote

```
# 100 total voting power in the system
push 100.0
store total_power

# 68 total votes cast in this proposal
push 68.0 
store votes_cast

# 42 votes in favor
push 42.0
store votes_for

# Check if proposal passes with majority (>50%)
load votes_for    # Votes in favor
load votes_cast   # Total votes cast
votethreshold 0.5  # Check 50% threshold of votes cast

if:
    emit "Proposal passes"
else:
    emit "Proposal fails"
```

#### Example: Supermajority Requirement

```
# 85 votes cast, 60 in favor
push 60.0  # Votes in favor
push 85.0  # Total votes cast
votethreshold 0.667  # Check 2/3 (66.7%) threshold

if:
    emit "Proposal passes with supermajority"
else:
    emit "Proposal fails to achieve supermajority"
```

### 4. Quorum Threshold Check (`quorumthreshold`)

Verifies that enough members participated in a vote to consider it valid:
- Prevents decisions made with insufficient participation
- Ensures broad representation in governance
- Can be combined with vote thresholds for comprehensive decision rules

#### Syntax

```
quorumthreshold <threshold>
```

Where:
- `<threshold>` is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the required portion of participation

The operation expects two values on the stack:
- The total possible voting power in the system
- The total voting power that participated

#### Example: Basic Quorum Check

```
# 200 total voting power in the system
push 200.0
store total_possible_votes

# 85 voting power participated
push 85.0
store votes_cast

# Check if vote meets 40% quorum
load total_possible_votes
load votes_cast
quorumthreshold 0.4

if:
    emit "Quorum reached, vote is valid"
else:
    emit "Quorum not reached, vote is invalid"
```

#### Example: Combined Quorum and Vote Threshold

```
# Setup system parameters
push 1000.0
store total_possible_votes

push 600.0
store votes_cast

push 400.0
store votes_for

# First check quorum (50% participation required)
load total_possible_votes
load votes_cast
quorumthreshold 0.5

if:
    emit "Quorum reached, checking vote threshold"
    
    # Now check vote threshold (2/3 of participants must approve)
    load votes_for
    load votes_cast
    votethreshold 0.667
    
    if:
        emit "Proposal passes with required supermajority"
    else:
        emit "Proposal fails: quorum reached but support threshold not met"
else:
    emit "Proposal invalid: quorum not reached"
```

## Building Complete Governance Systems

By combining these primitives, you can create sophisticated governance systems tailored to your cooperative's needs.

### Example: Complete Proposal Lifecycle

```
# Step 1: Proposal Creation and Deliberation Phase
# (This would be a separate process)

# Step 2: Voting Phase - Collect and count ranked votes
# (Collect ballots as shown in ranked vote example)

# Step 3: Process election with quorum and threshold checks
push 100.0
store total_members

push 72.0
store participants

# Check 50% quorum requirement
load total_members
load participants
quorumthreshold 0.5

if:
    # Quorum reached, process the ranked vote
    # (Assume 3 candidates and 72 ballots already on stack)
    rankedvote 3 72
    store winner
    
    # Emit the result
    emit "Winner is candidate: "
    load winner
    emit "ID"
else:
    emit "Vote failed due to insufficient participation"
```

### Example: Delegated Voting with Threshold

```
# Setup delegations
liquiddelegate "member1" "delegate_a"
liquiddelegate "member2" "delegate_a"
liquiddelegate "member3" "delegate_b"
liquiddelegate "member4" "delegate_c"
liquiddelegate "delegate_c" "delegate_b"

# Calculate effective voting power
# (This would be done by the system based on delegations)
push 5.0  # delegate_a's effective voting power (self + 2 delegations)
push 3.0  # delegate_b's effective voting power (self + 1 delegate + nested delegation)

# Record votes (for a simple yes/no vote)
push 5.0  # delegate_a votes yes with weight 5
push 0.0  # delegate_b votes no with weight 3

# Calculate totals
push 8.0  # Total voting power (5 + 3)
push 5.0  # Votes in favor (delegate_a only)

# Check if proposal passes with majority
votethreshold 0.5

if:
    emit "Proposal passes"
else:
    emit "Proposal fails"
```

## Governance Patterns and Best Practices

### Multi-stage Governance

For complex decisions, implement multi-stage governance processes:

1. **Proposal Submission**: Initial filtering using a low threshold
2. **Deliberation**: Structured discussion period
3. **Amendment**: Process for refining proposals
4. **Final Vote**: Higher threshold for binding decisions

Example structure:
```
# Stage 1: Submission
# Check if proposal meets basic requirements
push proposal_sponsors
push min_sponsors_required
gt
if:
    # Proceed to deliberation
else:
    emit "Insufficient sponsors"

# Stage 2: Deliberation
# (Implemented outside the VM)

# Stage 3: Final Vote
# Combined quorum and threshold check
```

### Specialized Governance for Different Decisions

Implement different governance mechanisms for different types of decisions:

- **Operational Decisions**: Simple majority with executive delegation
- **Policy Changes**: Higher thresholds with ranked voting
- **Constitutional Changes**: Super-majority with quorum requirements

### Checks and Balances

Implement checks and balances in your governance system:

- Separate proposal, deliberation, and execution powers
- Require multiple approvals for critical decisions
- Implement time delays for major changes
- Allow members to challenge decisions

### Increasing Participation

Design your governance system to encourage participation:

- Make delegation easy but transparent
- Allow partial delegation of voting power
- Implement reputation or incentive systems
- Provide clear, accessible information about proposals

## Advanced Governance Features

### Time-bound Voting

Implement time limits for voting periods:

```
# Example pseudocode (would require timestamp support)
push current_time
push voting_deadline
lt
if:
    # Process vote normally
else:
    emit "Voting period has ended"
```

### Quadratic Voting

Implement quadratic voting where cost increases quadratically with voting power:

```
# Example pseudocode
push vote_amount
dup
mul
store vote_cost

# Check if voter has enough tokens
load voter_balance
load vote_cost
gte
if:
    # Process vote with vote_amount power
else:
    emit "Insufficient voting tokens"
```

### Specialized Roles

Implement role-based governance where different roles have different powers:

```
# Check if user has required role
push user_id
push "moderator"
hasrole
if:
    # Allow moderator action
else:
    emit "Permission denied"
```

## Integration with External Systems

The ICN-COVM governance primitives can be integrated with:

- **Web Interfaces**: For accessible member participation
- **Notification Systems**: To alert members of governance activities
- **External Records**: To publish decisions transparently
- **Smart Contracts**: For automated execution of approved decisions

## Conclusion

The ICN-COVM governance primitives provide a powerful foundation for implementing democratic decision-making in cooperatives. By understanding and combining these primitives, you can create governance systems that are transparent, fair, and tailored to your cooperative's specific needs.

When designing your governance system, consider:
- The values and principles of your cooperative
- The practical needs for decision-making efficiency
- The importance of accessibility and participation
- The need for accountability and transparency

Experiment with different combinations of primitives and parameters to find the governance model that works best for your cooperative community.
