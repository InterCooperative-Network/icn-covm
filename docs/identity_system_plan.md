# Identity System Implementation Plan for ICN-COVM

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding an identity system to the ICN Cooperative Virtual Machine (ICN-COVM). The identity system is a critical component that will enable secure authentication, authorization, and attribution of actions within cooperative governance systems.

## Design Goals

1. **Security**: Strong cryptographic identity verification
2. **Flexibility**: Support for different identity schemes and verification methods
3. **Simplicity**: Easy-to-use API for common identity operations
4. **Privacy**: Appropriate controls for sensitive identity information
5. **Compatibility**: Integration with existing governance primitives
6. **Auditability**: Clear attribution of actions to identities

## Core Components

### 1. Identity Structure

Define a core identity structure:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Identity {
    // Unique identifier for the identity
    pub id: String,
    
    // Public key for verification (optional for some identity types)
    pub public_key: Option<Vec<u8>>,
    
    // Cryptographic scheme used (e.g., "ed25519", "secp256k1")
    pub scheme: String,
    
    // Additional metadata
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
    
    // Roles associated with this identity
    pub roles: Vec<String>,
}
```

### 2. Authentication Context

Create a context that holds the current execution identity:

```rust
pub struct AuthContext {
    // The identity performing the current operation
    pub caller: Identity,
    
    // Optional delegation chain (for delegated actions)
    pub delegation_chain: Vec<Identity>,
    
    // Timestamp when this context was created
    pub timestamp: u64,
    
    // Random nonce to prevent replay attacks
    pub nonce: Vec<u8>,
}
```

### 3. VM Integration

Extend the VM to include authentication context:

```rust
pub struct VM {
    // Existing fields...
    memory: HashMap<String, f64>,
    storage: Box<dyn StorageBackend>,
    
    // New fields
    auth_context: Option<AuthContext>,
}
```

### 4. New Operations

Add the following operations to the VM:

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `GetCaller` | Push the current caller's ID onto the stack |
| `HasRole(role)` | Check if the caller has a specific role |
| `RequireRole(role)` | Abort if the caller lacks a specific role |
| `RequireIdentity(id)` | Abort if the caller isn't the specified identity |
| `VerifySignature` | Verify a cryptographic signature against a message |
| `GetCallerMetadata(key)` | Access caller metadata for the specified key |
| `CheckDelegation` | Check if the current call is delegated |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Identity Structures

1. Define the `Identity` and `AuthContext` structures
2. Add authentication context field to VM struct
3. Create identity serialization and deserialization utilities
4. Implement basic identity creation and validation functions

### Phase 2: Basic Identity Operations

1. Implement `GetCaller` and `HasRole` operations
2. Update bytecode compiler and parser to handle new operations
3. Add tests for basic identity operations
4. Create mechanisms to pass identity context to VM at initialization

### Phase 3: Access Control and Permissions

1. Implement `RequireRole` and `RequireIdentity` operations
2. Create role-based access control for storage operations
3. Add permission validation hooks for cooperative governance primitives
4. Implement support for delegated actions with clear provenance

### Phase 4: Cryptographic Verification

1. Implement `VerifySignature` operation for different cryptographic schemes
2. Add signature generation utilities for testing
3. Create secure identity management and storage mechanisms
4. Implement mechanisms for cross-VM identity verification

## Identity System DSL Example

```
# Check if the caller has the "admin" role
hasrole "admin"
if:
    emit "Welcome, admin!"
else:
    emit "Access denied"
    exit

# Require the "treasurer" role for financial operations
requirerole "treasurer"

# Get the current caller's ID
getcaller
store "current_user"

# Verify a signature
push "message_to_verify"
push "base64_encoded_signature"
push "signer_public_key"
push "ed25519"
verifysignature
if:
    emit "Signature valid!"
else:
    emit "Invalid signature"
```

## Role Structure

We'll implement a hierarchical role system:

1. **System Roles**: Core system-level permissions
   - `system_admin`: Full system access
   - `system_auditor`: Read-only access to all logs

2. **Organization Roles**: Organization-specific permissions
   - `org_admin`: Full organization management
   - `org_member`: Basic organization membership
   - `org_treasurer`: Financial operations access

3. **Custom Roles**: User-definable roles for specific governance models
   - Example: `committee_member`, `project_lead`, etc.

## Identity Verification Flow

1. External system creates an `AuthContext` with caller identity
2. VM executes code with identity constraints
3. Operations check against the `AuthContext` for permission
4. Actions are attributed to the calling identity
5. Events include identity information for auditability

## Integration with Governance Primitives

Existing governance primitives will be enhanced with identity awareness:

1. **VoteThreshold**: Track who voted and their identity
2. **LiquidDelegate**: Verify delegation permissions
3. **RankedVote**: Authenticate voters and track ballots
4. **QuorumThreshold**: Validate voter identities in participation count

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Management**: Secure handling of cryptographic keys
2. **Replay Protection**: Prevent replaying of authenticated operations
3. **Delegation Security**: Secure and auditable delegation chains
4. **Privacy**: Appropriate exposure of identity information
5. **Role Separation**: Clear boundaries between system and user-defined roles

## Technical Challenges

1. **Cryptographic Library Choice**: Selecting appropriate and secure libraries
2. **Performance**: Efficient identity verification for frequent operations
3. **State Management**: Tracking identity context throughout VM execution
4. **Revocation**: Handling key/identity revocation and rotation
5. **Cross-VM Trust**: Establishing trust between federated VMs

## Future Extensions

1. **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Support for standard DID formats
2. **Verifiable Credentials**: Integration with VC verification
3. **Multi-signature**: Support for threshold signatures and multi-party approval
4. **Identity Recovery**: Mechanisms for identity recovery or rotation
5. **Reputation Systems**: Integration with cooperative reputation models

## Next Steps

1. Define the core `Identity` and `AuthContext` structures
2. Create utilities for identity creation and validation
3. Implement basic `GetCaller` and `HasRole` operations
4. Add identity context awareness to existing governance primitives
5. Develop comprehensive tests for the identity system
