# ICN Cooperative Virtual Machine Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic development path for the ICN Cooperative Virtual Machine (ICN-COVM), focusing on governance primitives and infrastructure for democratic computation in cooperatives.

## Current Release: v0.6.0 - Identity and Storage

The v0.6.0 release introduces two critical features:

- **Identity-Aware Execution**: Secure authentication and authorization for operations
  - Identity verification with cryptographic signatures 
  - Role-based access control for operations
  - Delegation chains for actions on behalf of others
  - Integration with VM operations

- **Persistent Storage**: Maintain state across VM executions
  - Key-value storage with namespaces
  - Transaction support for atomic operations
  - File-based storage backend implementation
  - In-memory storage for testing and development

## Previous Releases

### v0.5.0 - Liquid Democracy

This release introduced:

- **LiquidDelegate**: Allows members to delegate their voting power to others
- **VoteThreshold**: Conditional logic based on quorum and majority requirements
- **Governance Debug Mode**: Enhanced state visualization for governance operations

### v0.4.0 - RankedVote

The initial governance primitive implemented:

- **RankedVote**: Instant-runoff voting algorithm for ranked-choice elections
- Stack-based ballot handling
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Demo implementation showcasing practical application

## Upcoming Releases

### v0.7.0 - Economic Operations and Federation

**Target Date:** Q4 2024

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `EconomicOperations` | Resource allocation primitives for cooperative economics | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| `FederationProtocol` | Cross-VM communication for cooperative networks | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| `PolicyEngine` | DSL for defining organizational governance policies | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| `GovernanceHooks` | Event-triggered governance actions | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ |

- Integration with VM event system

### v0.8.0 - Visualization and Tools

**Target Date:** Q1 2025

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `GovernanceViz` | Visual representation of governance structures | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| `EnhancedDebugger` | Advanced debugging tools for governance logic | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| `TemplateLibrary` | Reusable governance components | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |

#### Implementation Details:

- Delegation graph visualization
- Voting power analysis tools
- Governance scenario simulations
- Simplified CCL creation tools

## Long-term Vision

The long-term goal for ICN-COVM is to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for democratic computation in cooperatives, enabling:

1. **Democratic Decision-Making** - Robust, transparent voting systems
2. **Governance as Code** - Programmatic expression of organizational bylaws
3. **Participatory Economics** - Fair resource allocation through democratic processes
4. **Interoperable Governance** - Standard protocols for cross-cooperative governance

### Future Research Areas

- Federation of multiple cooperative VMs
- Integration with blockchain technologies for transparent governance
- Real-time collaborative decision-making tools
- Formal verification of governance processes
