# ICN Cooperative Virtual Machine Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic development path for the ICN Cooperative Virtual Machine (ICN-COVM), focusing on governance primitives and infrastructure for democratic computation in cooperatives.

## Current Release: v0.4.0 - RankedVote

The initial governance primitive implemented in v0.4.0 is `RankedVote`, which provides:

- Instant-runoff voting algorithm for ranked-choice elections
- Stack-based ballot handling
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Demo implementation showcasing practical application

## Upcoming Releases

### v0.5.0 - Liquid Democracy

**Target Date:** Q2 2024

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `LiquidDelegate` | Allows members to delegate their voting power to others | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| `VoteThreshold` | Conditional logic based on quorum and majority requirements | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| Governance Debug Mode | Enhanced state visualization for governance operations | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ |

#### Implementation Details:

- `LiquidDelegate { from: String, to: String }` operation
- Delegation chain traversal with cycle detection
- Revocation mechanism for removing delegations
- Threshold-based operation execution
- Improved debugging tools for governance state

### v0.6.0 - Proportional Representation

**Target Date:** Q3 2024

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `ProportionalVote` | STV/proportional seat allocation for multi-winner elections | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| `PolicySet` | Declarative governance rule definitions | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| Simulation Suite | Test scenarios for complex governance situations | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ |

#### Implementation Details:

- Single Transferable Vote (STV) algorithm for proportional representation
- Policy DSL extension for declarative rule definition
- Integration with standard library
- Test suite for complex governance scenarios

### v0.7.0 - Governance as Code

**Target Date:** Q4 2024

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Policy Engine Parser | DSL for defining organizational governance policies | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| Governance Hooks | Event-triggered governance actions | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| Governance Analytics | Metrics and insights for governance processes | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ |

#### Implementation Details:

- Create a `policy.rs` DSL extension
- Define conditional governance rules
- Integration with VM event system
- Analytics and reporting for governance activities

## Long-term Vision

The long-term goal for ICN-COVM is to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for democratic computation in cooperatives, enabling:

1. **Democratic Decision-Making** - Robust, transparent voting systems
2. **Governance as Code** - Programmatic expression of organizational bylaws
3. **Participatory Economics** - Fair resource allocation through democratic processes
4. **Interoperable Governance** - Standard protocols for cross-cooperative governance

### Future Research Areas

- Federation of multiple cooperative VMs
- Integration with blockchain technologies for transparent governance
- Real-time collaborative decision-making tools
- Formal verification of governance processes
