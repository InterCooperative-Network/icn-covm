# ICN-COVM v0.6 Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for ICN-COVM v0.6, which introduced two foundational features:

1. ✅ **Persistent Storage System**: Enabling state persistence across program executions
2. ✅ **Identity and Authorization System**: Providing secure authentication and permissions

These features significantly enhanced the capabilities of the Cooperative Virtual Machine, allowing for more complex and secure governance applications.

## Timeline

| Week | Persistent Storage | Identity System | Integration |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | ✅ Define StorageBackend trait and interfaces | ✅ Define Identity and AuthContext structures | - |
| 2 | ✅ Implement InMemoryStorage and StoreP/LoadP operations | ✅ Implement GetCaller and HasRole operations | - |
| 3 | ✅ Add file-based storage backend and tests | ✅ Add RequireRole and identity initialization | ✅ Begin integration of systems |
| 4 | ✅ Implement transactions and namespace validation | ✅ Implement signature verification | ✅ Complete integration and testing |

## Implementation Strategy

We implemented both systems in parallel, with regular integration points to ensure they work well together. The storage system is identity-aware, and the identity system is designed with persistent storage capabilities in mind.

## Key Milestones

### Week 1: Core Interfaces and Structures

**Persistent Storage:**
- ✅ Define `StorageBackend` trait
- ✅ Create storage error types
- ✅ Add storage field to VM struct
- ✅ Implement basic key validation utilities

**Identity System:**
- ✅ Define `Identity` and `AuthContext` structures
- ✅ Add authentication context to VM
- ✅ Create identity serialization utilities
- ✅ Define role validation functions

### Week 2: Basic Operations

**Persistent Storage:**
- ✅ Implement `StoreP` and `LoadP` operations
- ✅ Create InMemoryStorage implementation
- ✅ Update bytecode compiler for storage ops
- ✅ Add basic storage tests

**Identity System:**
- ✅ Implement `GetCaller` and `HasRole` operations
- ✅ Update bytecode compiler for identity ops
- ✅ Create identity context initialization utilities
- ✅ Add basic identity tests

### Week 3: Advanced Features and Integration

**Persistent Storage:**
- ✅ Add file-based storage backend
- ✅ Implement namespace validation
- ✅ Add `DeleteP` and `KeyExists` operations
- ✅ Begin integration with identity system

**Identity System:**
- ✅ Implement `RequireRole` and `RequireIdentity`
- ✅ Add identity awareness to VM errors
- ✅ Create role-based access control hooks
- ✅ Begin integration with storage system

### Week 4: Transactions, Verification, and Completion

**Persistent Storage:**
- ✅ Implement transaction operations
- ✅ Add `ListKeys` operation
- ✅ Create storage inspection utilities
- ✅ Complete identity integration

**Identity System:**
- ✅ Implement `VerifySignature` operation
- ✅ Add signature generation for testing
- ✅ Create identity audit logging
- ✅ Complete storage integration

## Completion Status

All planned features for v0.6.0 have been successfully implemented. The implementation includes:

1. **Storage System**:
   - Full `StorageBackend` trait implementation
   - In-memory and file-based storage backends
   - Transaction support for atomic operations
   - Comprehensive test coverage

2. **Identity System**:
   - Identity verification with cryptographic signatures
   - Role-based access control
   - Delegation chains
   - Integration with VM operations

3. **Integration**:
   - Identity-aware storage operations
   - Proper permissions handling
   - Comprehensive test suite for combined usage

## Integration Points

The identity and storage systems have been integrated at several key points:

1. **Storage Permissions**: Storage operations validate against identity permissions
2. **Identity Persistence**: Identity roles and metadata can be stored in persistent storage
3. **Audit Trail**: Operations are logged with identity information
4. **Governance Enhancement**: Existing governance primitives have been updated for identity awareness

## New DSL Features

### Storage Operations

```
# Basic storage operations
push 100.0
storep "org/treasury/balance"
loadp "org/treasury/balance"

# Transaction support
begintx
push 90.0
storep "org/treasury/balance"
push 10.0
storep "org/projects/funding"
committx

# Key management
push "org/treasury/"
listkeys
```

### Identity Operations

```
# Identity verification
getcaller
store "current_user"

# Role-based access control
hasrole "treasurer"
if:
    # Perform treasurer operations
else:
    emit "Access denied"

# Require specific permissions
requirerole "admin"

# Signature verification
verifysignature
```

## Documentation and Examples

The following documentation and examples have been created:

1. **API Reference**: Complete documentation of all new operations
2. **Storage Guide**: Best practices for persistent storage usage
3. **Identity Guide**: How to implement secure identity verification
4. **Integration Examples**: Sample code demonstrating both systems together
5. **Test Suite**: Comprehensive tests for all new functionality

## Next Steps

With v0.6.0 complete, the project is now moving forward with plans for v0.7.0, which will focus on:

1. **Economic Operations**: Resource allocation primitives for cooperative economics
2. **Federation Protocol**: Cross-VM communication for cooperative networks
3. **Policy Engine**: DSL for defining organizational governance policies
4. **Governance Hooks**: Event-triggered governance actions
