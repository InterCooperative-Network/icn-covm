# ICN-COVM Principles and Governance

This document outlines the core principles, values, and governance structure that guide the development and operation of the Inter-Cooperative Network Cooperative Virtual Machine (ICN-COVM) project.

## Core Principles

### 1. Cooperative Ownership and Control

The ICN-COVM project is built on the fundamental principle that those who create, maintain, and use the software should collectively own and control it. This reflects the first cooperative principle of voluntary and open membership combined with democratic member control.

### 2. Federation and Autonomy

We believe in a federated approach where each cooperative entity maintains its autonomy while benefiting from network effects through collaboration. The technical architecture reflects this value by enabling sovereign nodes that can federate when and how they choose.

### 3. Transparency

All aspects of the project—from code to decision-making to finances—should be transparent to community members. This fosters trust and enables meaningful participation.

### 4. Inclusivity and Accessibility

The project strives to be accessible to cooperatives of all sizes and technical capabilities. We design for simplicity where possible and provide thorough documentation and support.

### 5. Privacy and Security by Design

We believe in building systems that respect user privacy and maintain strong security guarantees. Data sovereignty is a fundamental right of cooperatives using the system.

### 6. Economic Democracy

The tools we build should enable meaningful economic democracy within and between cooperatives, allowing for equitable resource allocation and value distribution.

## Project Governance Structure

The ICN-COVM project operates under a multi-stakeholder cooperative governance model:

### 1. Core Contributors Circle

Members who actively contribute to the code, documentation, or community support form the Core Contributors Circle. This group:
- Meets weekly to coordinate development efforts
- Makes day-to-day technical decisions through consensus
- Holds rotating facilitator roles (technical lead, community coordinator, etc.)

Membership in this circle is based on sustained participation and community recognition of contributions.

### 2. User Cooperatives Circle

Organizations that deploy and use ICN-COVM form the User Cooperatives Circle. This group:
- Provides feedback on features and priorities
- Participates in quarterly planning meetings
- Has formal input on the roadmap through proposal and voting mechanisms

Membership is open to any cooperative organization that uses the ICN-COVM platform.

### 3. Stewards Council

The Stewards Council consists of elected representatives from both the Core Contributors and User Cooperatives circles. This council:
- Ensures alignment with core principles
- Resolves conflicts when consensus cannot be reached in other circles
- Oversees project resources and fundraising efforts
- Meets monthly and reports transparently to the community

Council members serve one-year terms with staggered elections.

## Decision-Making Process

The ICN-COVM project uses the following decision-making processes:

### For Technical Decisions

1. **Proposal**: Anyone can propose changes through GitHub issues or pull requests
2. **Discussion**: Community discussion period (minimum 1 week for significant changes)
3. **Consensus-seeking**: Core Contributors seek consensus through discussion
4. **Decision**: Changes are accepted when consensus is reached among active Core Contributors
5. **Implementation**: Approved changes are implemented, documented, and communicated

### For Strategic Decisions

1. **Proposal**: Formal proposals can be submitted by any member of either circle
2. **Review**: Initial review by the Stewards Council for alignment with principles
3. **Deliberation**: Community-wide discussion period (2-4 weeks)
4. **Voting**: When needed, formal voting occurs using ranked-choice or other appropriate methods
5. **Implementation**: Results are documented and executed by the appropriate circle

## Contribution Recognition

The ICN-COVM project recognizes various forms of contribution:

- **Code contributions**: Development, testing, and maintenance
- **Documentation**: Creating and improving user and developer documentation
- **Community support**: Helping users, facilitating discussions, mentoring new contributors
- **Outreach**: Representing the project at events, creating educational materials
- **User feedback**: Providing valuable feedback based on real-world usage

All forms of contribution are valued and acknowledged in project communications and release notes.

## Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise, we follow this escalation path:

1. **Direct dialogue**: Parties attempt to resolve the issue directly
2. **Facilitated discussion**: A neutral facilitator from the community helps guide resolution
3. **Circle deliberation**: The relevant circle discusses and attempts to find consensus
4. **Stewards Council**: If unresolved, the Stewards Council mediates and makes a decision

Throughout this process, we commit to:
- Focusing on interests rather than positions
- Maintaining respect for all parties
- Documenting the process and outcome transparently
- Learning from conflicts to improve our governance

## Evolving Governance

This governance model itself is subject to evolution through the same processes it describes. We recognize that as the project grows, our governance needs will change, and we commit to adapt accordingly while maintaining alignment with our core principles.

## Participating in Governance

To participate in ICN-COVM governance:

1. Join our [Matrix community](https://matrix.to/#/#icn-covm:matrix.org)
2. Attend open community calls (held biweekly)
3. Contribute to discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/cooperative-computing/icn-covm)
4. Participate in your relevant circle's activities

All are welcome to participate in governance discussions, regardless of technical expertise or contribution history.
